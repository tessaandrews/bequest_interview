# Tamper Proof Data

At Bequest, we require that important user data is tamper proof. Otherwise, our system can incorrectly distribute assets if our internal database is breached. 
Only the user is able to update their own data.


**1. How does the client insure that their data has not been tampered with? Assume that the database is compromised.**

The client can insure that their data has not been tampered with due to encryption, and security keys which prevent possible breachers from accessing sensitive information in its fullest form. By encrypting the data, we are able to sequence it in a way to guarantee those seeing it without the decryption key are unable to make sense of the information, deeming it unusable.

**2. If the data has been tampered with, how can the client recover the lost data?**

The client can recover the lost data through system backups, or an external hard drive if all system data is compromised. In order to ensure utmost safety in data retrieval, a paper trail of all data is also useful to provide security. Paper trails of sensitive data may be encrypted as well, if the breach may have been personal.
